Apt is the simplified package manager introduced in Ubuntu 16.04 which consolidates the previous apt-get, for new users. Main options to look out for are:

	list 		    -> list packages based on names
	show 		    -> show package details
	update		    -> update list of available packages
	install 	    -> install package
	remove 		    -> remove package
	upgrade 	    -> upgrade the system by installing/upgrading packages
	autoremove      -> automatically remove unused packages

example:
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade -y
    sudo apt install bridge-utils
    apt show docker.io
