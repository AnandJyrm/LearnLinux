Apt is the new package manager introduced in Ubuntu 16.04 which simplifies and consolidates the various functions performed by apt-get. Main options to look out for are:

	list 		 -> list packages based on names
	show 		 -> show package details
	update		 -> update list of available packages
	install 	 -> install package
	remove 		 -> remove package
	upgrade 	 -> upgrade the system by installing/upgrading packages
	full-upgrade -> upgrade the system; can also remove existing packages
	autoremove   -> automatically remove unused packages
